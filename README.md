Various mapkeys and batch scripts for PTC Creo Parametric

Place the batch folder in C:\PTC\Creo\
The contents of the mapkey text files must be placed in your config.sup or one of the config.pro files. Config.sup is preferred for administrators.

If you have requests for Creo mapkeys submit as an issue. I may or may not have a solution.
